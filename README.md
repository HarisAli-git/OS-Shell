# Linux Shell

## Brief Overview:
A proper Linux Shell implemented using execv commands

## Basic Working:
The Shell works by using the functions of stringtok and directory search
1. The command, including the pipes, is seperated into tokens
2. The operation to be performed is taken as a seperate token
3. This seperate token is searched over within directories of the pre-compiled codes of the system
4. As soon as the corresponding compilation is found that command is executed
5. The pipes and each command works perfectly for each case scenerio

## Note:
1. The terminal is not implemented in loop
2. This project is open source, so whoever whishes to add something in it or contribute, he/she can!
